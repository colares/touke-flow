ToUke
==========

Translates any music sheet chords (from www.cifraclub.com.br) from any instrument to ukulele. This is the first step from a lot of other possibilities we want to achieve and build with a FLOSS (Free/Libre and Open Source Software) version of a chords / tab full site.

#### Ukulele
The ukulele ([ˈʔukuˈlɛlɛ], oo-koo-le-le) is a Hawaiian member of the guitar family of instruments; it generally employs four nylon or gut strings or four courses of strings and originated in the 19th century. [Find more about Ukulele at Wikipedia.
